# Mandate: notes for coding agents

Mandate is an AUGUR pillar app: intent, passed down the floors. It lives in its own repository and is
built only against AUGUR's published packages (`@augur/*`, aliased from `@harry-burton-dev/augur-*` on
GitHub Packages). AUGUR itself, its ADRs and its guides are in the `augur` repository; read its
AGENTS.md and the ADRs there before changing how this app reaches the platform.

## Where to look
- AUGUR's decisions (ADRs and PDRs) in the Decision register, in the AUGUR handbook on Google Drive
  (`04 Decisions`, https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16wXmUMRNP2_vXAlf4kBMF9hCDNUXg7yO), especially 0012 (apps in their own repositories), 0015
  (React, Quill, Tailwind) and 0047 (how this repository releases).
- This repository's own decisions are in the same register, under its name. Records are never written into
  a repository: ask for a number and send what was decided and why.
- The task: its Linear issue (team PER, initiative AUGUR).

## Rules
- The same rules as AUGUR: names, limits and URLs come from config or the manifest, never literals from chat;
  unavailable things stay visible and say why; a new dependency needs a record.
- Reach AUGUR only through `@augur/*` packages, the gateway, the manifest and events. Never bundle React or
  the kit: the shell serves them (`isSharedModule` in vite.config.ts).
- Every pull request carries a changeset (`pnpm changeset`). Merging the Version packages pull request
  releases the app as a beta; AUGUR's Promote to stable makes it stable.
- `pnpm install`, then `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`. Locally you need
  `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` set to a token that can read GitHub Packages.
- Before a pull request: REVIEW.md. The paths it changes set its tier, which says what it needs before it
  merges (the description's sections, a `/code-review` run, Harry's ok on his paths); the Review check checks it.
- Merge your own pull request once CI and the Review check are green, after merging fresh `origin/main` into it.
- Nothing in the repository names the tool that wrote it: no assistant trailers on commits or attribution
  in pull requests, and no links to private chats.
